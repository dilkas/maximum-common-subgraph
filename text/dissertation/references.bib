 abstract = {This paper describes and discusses graphical techniques, based on the primitive empirical cumulative distribution function and on quantile (Q - Q) plots, percent (P - P) plots and hybrids of these, which are useful in assessing a one-dimensional sample, either from original data or resulting from analysis. Areas of application include: the comparison of samples; the comparison of distributions; the presentation of results on sensitivities of statistical methods; the analysis of collections of contrasts and of collections of sample variances; the assessment of multivariate contrasts; and the structuring of analysis of variance mean squares. Many of the objectives and techniques are illustrated by examples.},
